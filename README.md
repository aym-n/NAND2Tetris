# NAND2Tetris Course Repository

This repository contains HDL files and assignments for the NAND2Tetris course, which explores computer architecture from basic logic gates to a fully functional modern computer. The course provides a hands-on understanding of computer systems by breaking down layers of abstraction and building each component from scratch.

## Contents

- HDL implementations for various computer components
- Assignments covering Boolean logic, computer architecture, assembly and more
- Projects that progressively build a complete computer system
